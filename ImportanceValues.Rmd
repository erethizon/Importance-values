## Introduction

This is the code that we need to calculate the importance values for species of trees in a single forest.  

## Step 1. Set up the workspace

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Step 2.  Import data and isolate to a single forest

```{r}
trees<-read.csv("cleanTrees.csv", sep = ",")
```
Source custom functions
```{r}
source("ImportanceFunctions.R")
```
Determine how many forests there are
```{r}
Forests<-count_forests(trees)
```
Now clean up DBH < 10
```{r}
trees<-fix_dbh(trees)
```
